Module: adaptive_allocation_engine.py
Purpose: Adaptive Allocation Engine (Decision-Making) for the Adaptive Resource Allocation System.

This module receives aggregated system metrics (simulated in this example), applies rule-based decision logic 
based on predefined thresholds, and outputs resource allocation recommendations in JSON format.

Simulated Aggregated Metrics:
- CPU average: 85.0 (which triggers a "reduce_non_critical" decision because it exceeds the threshold of 80.0)
- Memory average: 70.0 (within acceptable range, so "normal" decision)
- Timestamp: "2025-02-14T17:06:48Z"
